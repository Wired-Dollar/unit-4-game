1- 12 , 19-120

Use Bootstrap to create 5 rows.
1
First row is the header showing the name of the game Crystals Collector.
2
Second row contains the directions and rules of the game.
3
Third row has two containers.
First container displays the target number which is somewhere between 19 and 120 generated by a getRandom() method
Second container displays the count of wins vs loses which is determined by if you reach the target number (win) or go over (loss) using an if totalNumber =!> targetNumber formula
4
Fourth row contains 4 pictures of crystals of different shape and color. Each of these crystals is assigned a mathRandom() upon an onClick to add to the running totalNumber until targetNumber is >= totalNumber.
5
Fifth row contains the current totalNumber for display for player. 

totalNumber is reset to zero after a win/loss is tallied.
At the end of each game the mathRandom numbers are reset for the targetNumber and each of the crystals and the game begins again.
